# ðŸ“˜ `apps_tb` â€” Buwana Application Registry Table

The `apps_tb` table is where all the juicy metadata about third-party or internal applications that use the Buwana authentication platform is stored. If an app wants to play nice with the Buwana login system, it better register here first!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This table enables Buwana to:
- Store app-specific login and branding configurations
- Handle OAuth details like client ID and secret
- Display terms, privacy policies, and emoji-based UI themes per app
- Track app-specific user registration and authentication
- Integrate app-specific URLs for login, logout, and redirects

It's basically the app passport control of Buwana: no app gets in without it.

## ðŸš€ Quick Tips

- `client_id` and `client_secret` are essential for OAuthâ€”donâ€™t leave â€˜em blank unless you want your app leaking like a sieve.
- Want your login screen to sparkle? Use `app_emojis_array` for animated flair.
- Store Terms and Privacy in HTML format. Inject directly into modalsâ€”no escapes needed.
- Use the `app_owners_tb` join table to keep track of which Earthling birthed each app.

This table is **Pending Dev** â€” which means itâ€™s locked and loaded but the admin UI for app creation and management is still baking. Manual insertions only for now.
