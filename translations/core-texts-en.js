In this way, ecobrickers around the world would be able to refer with one word to the same concept, and web searches and hashtags would accelerate global dissemination. See wikipedia.org/ecobricks for the full history.",

These basins are a natural boundary that captures and channels precipitation through a network of rivers, streams, and underground aquifers, eventually directing the water to a common outlet. Watersheds play a crucial ecological role and provide water for human use. The health and management of watersheds are vital for ecological vitality.",
