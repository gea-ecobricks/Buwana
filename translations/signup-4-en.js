These basins form natural boundaried bioregions, usually demarked by the crests of hills or mountains. Watersheds play a crucial ecological role and provide water for human use.",

OpenStreetMap is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, rivers, trails, and much more, all over the world. OpenStreetMap is open-data and open-source: anyone is free to use it for any purpose as long as you credit OpenStreetMap and its contributors.",
